# Wallpaper Changer

### This application takes images from the latest comments from a reddit bot ("ze-robot") and changes the desktop wallpaper on Windows.

## Setup:

1. Create an Reddit Application from https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Create a .env file. In the .env file:
   - Include the username, password of your reddit account
   - Also include the client-id and client-secret of your reddit application you just created.
   - For example:
     - usr=<USERNAME>
     - pass=<PASSWORD>
     - client-id=<CLIENT-ID>
     - client-secret=<CLIENT-SECRET>
3. In the config.ini file, edit your reddit application_name you created in step 1. After that, also edit the wallpaperSettings to your preferences (width, height, max_number_of_pictures)

4. Run run.py or run.exe!
